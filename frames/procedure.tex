\begin{frame}{Procedure}

We survey participants with the objective of mapping perceptual similarity in two parts:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item ``globally'': getting a consensus on what tactons are similar across a large number of tactons and of annotators.
    \item ``locally'': attempting to extract groups of people who share haptic perceptual similarity.
\end{enumerate}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Procedure}

\begin{itemize}
    \item We conducted $R=8$ rounds of $c=6$ tactons each
    \item Five of those rounds were dedicated to the ``global'' experiment, while three were dedicated to the ``local'' experiment
    \item At each round the participants were asked to produce \textit{at least} two groups according to how similar they perceived the VT stimuli
    \item We allowed participants to produce singletons
\end{itemize}
