    \begin{itemize}
        \item Haptics: the sense of touch
        \item Tacton: \textit{Tactile Icon}
        \item Structured abstract tactile messages that encode information that can be carried non-visually, usually via tactile encoding or via force.
        \item The design of tactons is typically left to an ``expert'' although there are some libraries that contain a lexicality
        \item This lengthy design process hinders development of haptic technologies both on the research-side and the consumer side
        \item We focus on Vibrotactile (VT) tactons that are \texit{binary} (ON/OFF)
    \end{itemize}
