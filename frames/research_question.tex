\begin{frame}{Research Question}
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Can we predict the perceptual similarity of VT tactons?
        \begin{itemize}
            \item How to do it efficiently across the whole space of tactons (of vibrations)
            \item How to conduct user studies for haptics in a remote environment such as crowdsourcing platforms
        \end{itemize}
    
        \item Investigate the perceptual similarity of haptics \textit{across users}. This relates to the idea of \textit{personalizing} the stimuli.
    \end{itemize}
