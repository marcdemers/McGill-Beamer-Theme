        \item We develop an Android application for smartphones that can render VT stimuli and gather feedback about them.
        \item We gather large amounts of feedback in a crowdsourced setting, via Amazon Mechanical Turk~\footnote{https://www.mturk.com/} (AMT).
        \item We apply our graph theoretic methodology to analyzing the data.
        \item We use a hold-out set to predict similarity between never-seen-before tacton pairs in the graph.
