\begin{frame}{Motivation \& Challenges}

  
  \begin{itemize}
      \item Countless papers run user studies to find parameters that influence our perception of tactons, but reinvent the wheel on each iteration
      \item Need for characterizing Individual Differences (IDs) in our perception of tactons
      \item Only a subset of the tacton space is explored on every iteration, making scalability difficult
      \item Generating tactons that elicit certain responses from the user is the next logical step, but very little is currently known from our \textit{perception} of tactons
  \end{itemize}
